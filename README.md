# Laravel BlogApp

This project is an API project that I made using the Repository design pattern in Laravel and the project has a blog and category table and the operations between them 
Trait was also used in the project and there is a system similar to Generics

# To run it
Open terminal and type "php artisan migrate" and transfer the database (Xampp must be open) then type "php artisan serve" and run it
